# Query Formulation

Condense the query into a **short, focused phrase** — ideally 3–6 keywords. Long sentences reduce result count and relevance.

| Instead of… | Use… |
|:---|:---|
| "how do I configure ESLint with flat config in a TypeScript project" | "ESLint flat config TypeScript" |
| "what is the best way to handle authentication in Next.js 14" | "Next.js 14 authentication" |
| "how to fix CORS error when calling API from React frontend" | "React CORS fix API" |

Rules:
- Strip filler words (how, what, why, best way to, etc.)
- Keep proper nouns, version numbers, and technical terms
- One concept per search — split compound questions into separate queries
- For deep/thorough research mode, you may expand slightly, but still aim for under 10 words
